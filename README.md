# -Dq.io-SQL_Guided-_Project_Designing_and_Creating_a_Database
My Take on Dataquest.io's Guided Project, creating an SQL Database from retrosheet's Major League Baseball Dataset.

https://www.retrosheet.org/gamelogs/index.html

The main goal of this mission was to


    Import CSV data into a database.
    Design a normalized schema for a large, predominantly single table data set.
    Create tables that match the schema design.
    Migrate data from unnormalized tables into our normalized tables.
